# url_download
Video downloading through m3u8 urls or files both programs take in playlist m3u8 files not chunk lists.
I made this for fun because I had some free time. ***Most likely I woun't finish the extra features.***

## Features to add:
* loading bar
* proper url handling so that you donw have to manually enter the domain name in the code
* option to download from either chunklist or playlist
* finish filedialog window
* make a gui
* make gui to choose which chunklist from playlist to download
* and much more
